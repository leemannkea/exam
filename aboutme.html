            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>The eternal question. My name is Lee Mann, I am 24 and soon to be 25 years old. To today's date, 6/06/18, I have lived in Copenhagen for 1010 days. Prior to my time at KEA, I studied at Camberwell College of Arts, University of the Arts, London. In 2015, I was awarded a Bachelors with Honours in Photography. I did not take a single photograph in the duration of my studies.</p>
